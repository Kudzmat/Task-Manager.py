# Task-Manager.py
This is a program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team.
This program works primarily with two text files, user.txt and tasks.txt.

tasks.txt stores a list of all the tasks that the team is working on as well as:
The username of the person to whom the task is assigned.
■ The title of the task.
■ A description of the task.
■ The date that the task was assigned to the user.
■ The due date for the task.
■ Either a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ value that specifies if the task has been
completed yet.

user.txt stores the username and password for each user that has permission to use your program, new users are added by the admin.
The user will be prompted to enter a username and password.If the user enters a username that is not listed in user.txt or enters a valid username but not a valid password. The user will repeatedly be asked to enter a valid username and password until they provide appropriate credentials.
The program will also record the stats of how many projects users have completed or have not completed.
